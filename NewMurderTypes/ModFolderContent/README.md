# Piepieonline's NewMurderTypes

BETA RELEASE - Everything seems to behave, but it's not tested as much as I'd like yet.

Adds a touch more content to the game, and setting up to add more in the future.
I won't be surprised if much of this is replaced by the actual dev team in time, but it's something for now.

Current State
* Add one new murder 'template' to the game (Can be turned off)
* Modifies the cipher used by killers, to one of 3 options randomly (Vanilla and two new, can be turned off)

<details>
  <summary>Spoilers - New Murder Templates</summary>

* Botched Robbery
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Major Spoilers - Cipher Details</summary>

* Vanilla
* ROT X, where X is between 5 and 21
* Atbash
</details>

Future State (Hopefully)
* More new murder templates
* Variations for default templates (Corpo killer especially)
* New side jobs

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\NewMurderTypes\NewMurderTypes.dll"
