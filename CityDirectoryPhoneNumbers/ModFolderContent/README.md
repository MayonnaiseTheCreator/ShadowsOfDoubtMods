# Piepieonline's CityDirectoryPhoneNumbers

Changes the city directory to list phone numbers instead of addresses. Thanks to Dusty926 on Discord for the suggestion.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\RealEstateListingCruncherApp\CityDirectoryPhoneNumbers.dll"
