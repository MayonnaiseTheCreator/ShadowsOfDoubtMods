# Piepieonline's ApartmentRent

Adds rental payments that are due on a regular schedule. Also enables the 'tired' debuff, to encourage you to own an apartment.
When you miss your rental payment, the door will be locked and barred (barging is also blocked) and you need to pay the missed payments back to regain access.


# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\ApartmentRent\ApartmentRent.dll"
