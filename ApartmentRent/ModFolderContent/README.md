# Piepieonline's ApartmentRent

Adds rental payments that are due on a regular schedule.
When you miss your rental payment, the door will be locked and barred (barging is also blocked) and you need to pay the missed payments back to regain access.

SODQOL is recommended to enable the tired effect, which will encourage renting an apartment.

Currently, there isn't a way to find the next payment date and amount, so I recommend pinning a note with this information.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\ApartmentRent\ApartmentRent.dll"
