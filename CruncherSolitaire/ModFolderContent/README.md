# Piepieonline's CruncherSolitaire

Adds a solitaire app to residential crunchers, adding something else to do between cases.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\CruncherSolitaire\CruncherSolitaire.dll"

# Configuration

* Contains an option to change the speed of the game in the background while playing. I recommend not going above veryFast.

# Credits:

* Thanks to Ray on the discord for providing the assets I've used!

# Known Issues

* State is lost when the cruncher is restarted (including when the game unloads and reloads it)
* Card stacks can go off the screen if they get too long
* Occasionally a card can flip in the wrong place when clicking through the deck
